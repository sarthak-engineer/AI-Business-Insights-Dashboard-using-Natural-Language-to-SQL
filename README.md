# Kannada SQL AI Project 📊

## Problem Statement
Business users and analysts frequently require immediate, ad-hoc data insights to make informed decisions. However, they consistently face a bottleneck in relying on data engineers because they lack the required SQL expertise. This project aims to bridge the gap by allowing users to instantly generate complex SQL queries and visualize the results simply by asking questions in natural English.

## Architecture
1. **User Question:** The user types their question into the Streamlit dashboard input field.
2. **AI Translation:** The system sends the prompt to the `Google Gemini AI` API which generates a structured PostgreSQL query matching the application schema.
3. **Database Query:** The generated SQL is transmitted to a cloud-hosted `Supabase PostgreSQL` instance via a custom RPC function.
4. **Insight Visualization:** The results are parsed by `Pandas` and automatically rendered on the Streamlit UI containing KPI Metrics, side-by-side Tables and dynamic Charts, and natural language AI Summaries.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend / Prototyping:** Streamlit
- **Backend Processing:** Python 3, Pandas
- **Database Architecture:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Natural Language Processing:** Google Gemini AI API (`google-genai` package)

## Results
The completed system serves as a fully functional Business Intelligence tool. Users can type questions such as *"sales in Bangalore in March"*, and the AI reliably translates standard date strings to date ranges, executes the database request without case-sensitivity errors, and builds out dynamic visual comparisons accurately over the web application.
