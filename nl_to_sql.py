def generate_sql(question):

    prompt = f"""
    Convert the following question into PostgreSQL SQL.

    Rules:
    1. Table name is ecommerce_behavior
    2. Use columns: customer_id, age, gender, income_level, marital_status, education_level, occupation, location, purchase_category, purchase_amount, frequency_of_purchase, purchase_channel, brand_loyalty, product_rating, time_spent_on_product_researchhours, social_media_influence, discount_sensitivity, return_rate, customer_satisfaction, engagement_with_ads, device_used_for_shopping, payment_method, time_of_purchase, discount_used, customer_loyalty_program_member, purchase_intent, shipping_preference, time_to_decision
    3. Use case-insensitive search with ILIKE
    4. Support date filtering if time_of_purchase is queried. Assume current year 2026.
    5. CRITICAL: ALL NUMBER COLUMNS (like purchase_amount, age, product_rating, return_rate, time_spent_on_product_researchhours) are stored as TEXT. If you use aggregate functions (SUM, AVG) or if you use mathematical operators (>, <, =, etc.), you MUST cast the column to numeric first. Example: CAST(age AS NUMERIC) > 18 or SUM(CAST(purchase_amount AS NUMERIC)).
    6. Only return SQL query. Do not include a trailing semicolon (;) and do not include any comments.
